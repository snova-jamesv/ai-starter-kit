SambaNova AI Starter Kits
====================

# Overview
SambaNova AI Starter Kits are a collection of open-source examples and guides to facilitate the deployment of AI-driven use cases in the enterprise.

To run these examples, youâ€™ll need access to a SambaStudio environment with your models deployed to endpoints. Most code examples are written in Python, though the concepts can be applied in any language.

If you have any issues with the examples or would be willing to provide feedback, please let us know by [creating an issue](https://github.com/sambanova/ai-starter-kit/issues/new/choose) in GitHub.
